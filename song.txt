You look pretty in your fancy dress
But I detect unhappiness
You never speak so I have to guess
You're not free

There, maybe when you're old enough
You'll realize that you're not so tough
And some days the seas get rough
And you'll see

You're too young to have it figured out
You think you know what you're talking about
You think it will all work itself out
But we'll see

When I was young I thought I knew
You probably think you know too
Do you?
Well do you?

I was naive just like you
I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to do
Well, what you gonna do?
(What a fool)
